## Lab Learning Goals

* Emphasize plotting and array math (since that is what we will be learning in the book and in class)
* Have them collect X data points from TMP36 sensor and store in array. *Then* have them perform the conversion on that array to get temperatures. Then have them plot.

## Ideas

* get a cold can of soda or something and monitor how it gets to room temperature over time. Compare to Newton's law of coolins.
