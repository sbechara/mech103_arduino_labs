## Lab Learning Goals

* Need to use if statements on their own
* Have students actually create flowcharts and/or pseudocode and have them turn that in

## Ideas

* have students create an "analog" ultrasonic proximity sensor.
* use the servo motors to create a dial that shows how far or close an object is.
* Grading, have to show the LA's that it works and explain code?
