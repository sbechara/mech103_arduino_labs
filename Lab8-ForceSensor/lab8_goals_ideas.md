## Lab Learning Goals

* Students will not have enough to do the idea below. That is ok I think. Instead have them concentrate on using a template if statement and tweaking it.
* Have students actually create flowcharts and/or pseudocode and have them turn that in

## Ideas

* have students figure out a good threshold by trial and error
* create an infinite loop, *if* force sensor value > threshold, beep speaker or blink LED.
* Could make it like an indiana jones alarm game thing?
