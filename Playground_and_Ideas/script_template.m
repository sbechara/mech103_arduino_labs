% Description:
% ------------
% This simply serves as a template so that you can create nice, pretty
% headers for your script files in the future. This text should be replaced
% by WHAT your script file does. Keep in mind, this is NOT the template
% that you should use when creating FUNCTIONS. We will get to that later...
